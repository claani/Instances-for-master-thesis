# Instances-for-master-thesis

This repository store the instance I used in my master thesis for computation. All file named in the following way, "tri_graph_n_i_distanceType.gph". 
* "n" means the totally number of nodes in the graph.
* "i" is just the label
* distanceType means the different disctance we used
Then the format of all file is the following:
* "V i" means here is a node i
* "E i j c", means here is a edge between node i and node j with cost c
* "D i d" means the demand of node i is d

We assume the start is node 0 and the end is node n-1
